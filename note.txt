should mainly be used to consider only continuous actions (eg. redispatch, set_storage or curtail). Though it is possible to use 
"change_bus" when building it, be aware that this discrete action will be treated as continuous. Consider using the "MultiDiscreteActSpace" 
for these attributes.

should mainly be used to consider only discrete actions (eg. set_line_status, set_bus or change_bus). Though it is possible to use 
"set_storage" when building it, be aware that this continuous action will be treated as discrete by splitting it into bins. Consider using 
the "BoxGymActSpace" for these attributes.
